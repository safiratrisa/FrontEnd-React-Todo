## Getting Started

### Installation

If you want to run this project locally, I recommend you to configure the [Back-End](https://github.com/safiratrisa/Backend-Todo) first before configuring this repo front-end.
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/safiratrisa/FrontEnd-React-Todo.git
```
 2. Install NPM packages
```
npm install
```
3. Add .env file at root folder project, and add following
```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL = 'http://localhost:1234/'
```
4. Run the project
```
  npm run serve
```
